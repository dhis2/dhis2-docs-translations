> WARNING:
> Updates should not be made directly in this repository. This repository is purely for backing up translations managed on transifex.com

To backup translations, checkout the master branch, then:

```
source source_me
```

_This assumes you have linked with the DHIS2 transifex account (i.e. have the relevant ~/.transifexrc file on your system)_
